Support Android platform.

CaffeOnACL is a project that is maintained by **OPEN** AI LAB, it uses Arm Compute Library (NEON+GPU) to speed up [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and provide utilities to debug, profile and tune application performance. 

The release version is 0.4.0, is based on [Rockchip RK3399](http://www.rock-chips.com/plus/3399.html) Platform, target OS is Ubuntu 16.04. Can download the source code from [OAID/CaffeOnACL](https://github.com/OAID/CaffeOnACL)

* The ARM Computer Vision and Machine Learning library is a set of functions optimised for both ARM CPUs and GPUs using SIMD technologies. See also [Arm Compute Library](https://github.com/ARM-software/ComputeLibrary).
* Caffe is a fast open framework for deep learning. See also [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe).

### Arm Compute Library Compatibility Issues :
There are some compatibility issues between ACL and Caffe Layers, we bypass it to Caffe's original layer class as the workaround solution for the below issues

* Normalization in-channel issue
* Tanh issue
* Softmax supporting multi-dimension issue
* Group issue

Performance need be fine turned in the future
